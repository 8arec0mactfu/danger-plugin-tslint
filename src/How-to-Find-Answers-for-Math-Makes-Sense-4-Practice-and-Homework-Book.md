One option to find answers for the Practice and Homework Book is to check with your teacher or school. Some teachers may provide answer keys or solutions manuals for their students to use as a reference or a self-check tool. Some schools may also have online platforms or websites where they post answer keys or solutions manuals for students to access. For example, you can find some answer keys for the Practice and Homework Book on this website: [http://behlblog.weebly.com/resources-gr-4.html](http://behlblog.weebly.com/resources-gr-4.html) [^1^]. However, this option may not be available for all teachers or schools, so you should always ask your teacher or school first before using any online resources.
 
Another option to find answers for the Practice and Homework Book is to use other online resources that may have similar questions or problems as the ones in the book. For example, you can use Google Books to preview some pages of the Practice and Homework Book and see if there are any questions or problems that match the ones you are looking for. You can find the Google Books preview of the Practice and Homework Book here: [https://books.google.com/books/about/Math\_Makes\_Sense\_4\_Practice\_and\_Homework.html?id=N1nMAAAACAAJ](https://books.google.com/books/about/Math_Makes_Sense_4_Practice_and_Homework.html?id=N1nMAAAACAAJ) [^2^]. You can also use other websites that offer math worksheets, videos, games, or tutorials that cover the same topics as the ones in the book. For example, you can find some math resources for grade 4 students on this website: [https://sites.google.com/st-anns.ca/mrs-bradbury/math-8](https://sites.google.com/st-anns.ca/mrs-bradbury/math-8) [^4^]. However, this option may not be very reliable or accurate, as different online resources may have different methods, formats, or levels of difficulty than the ones in the book.
 
A third option to find answers for the Practice and Homework Book is to try to solve the questions or problems yourself using your own knowledge, skills, and strategies. This option may be the most beneficial for your learning and understanding of math concepts and skills, as it allows you to practice your problem-solving skills, check your work, and learn from your mistakes. You can use your Student Book, your class notes, your textbook examples, or other math tools (such as calculators, manipulatives, charts, etc.) to help you solve the questions or problems in the Practice and Homework Book. You can also ask your teacher, your classmates, your family members, or other people who are good at math for help if you get stuck or need clarification. However, this option may also be the most challenging and time-consuming one, as it requires you to work independently and diligently on each question or problem.
 
In conclusion, there are different options to find answers for the Math Makes Sense 4 Practice and Homework Book depending on your situation. You should always check with your teacher or school first before using any online resources. You should also try to solve the questions or problems yourself using your own knowledge, skills, and strategies as much as possible.
